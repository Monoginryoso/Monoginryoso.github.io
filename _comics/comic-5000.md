An attempt to create a comic strip and simulate the hand-drawn effect in computer graphics.

The comic strip depicts the use of laboratory materials and equipment to pay homage to the scene in the movie *The Matrix Reloaded* where Neo stops bullets.

### Process: 

* Storyboarding

    - Also changed the appearance of the safety goggles in the second scene for uniformity.
