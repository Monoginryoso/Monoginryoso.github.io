I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Sciences with a passion for doodling on my iPad. My artwork often centers around biology or other scientific fields, featuring original characters as well as occasional fanart pieces.

This website serves as a platform to showcase the concepts and creative processes behind my artworks.
