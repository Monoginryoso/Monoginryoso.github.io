### Process: 

* Idea
    - Based on the lyrics
        >片目閉じて心をみつめ<br>(close one eye and gaze into the heart)

        >消えてくひとつひとつの激情でさえ/確かな脈のひとつとなる<br>(even each fading passion/becomes one of the certain pulses)
<br>
    - and a rhythm similar to cardiac rhythm, created multiple versions of the composition.

* Rough
    - The third version from the left was chosen as a rough. A silhouette was designed for interlocking hair.

* Base color
    - The color palette and border pattern of the album cover illustration were referenced.

* Rendering
    - Added raindrops and improved the structure of the shoulder and neck sections. Determine the visual of the final version.
