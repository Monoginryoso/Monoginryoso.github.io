### Process: 

* Rough
    - The pose in the MV was considered first, but it was compositional imbalance and I had problems with the anatomy.

* Another pose
    - So the legs were changed to this position that supports the hand.

* Color rough
    - Develop the overall color palette. Used more fluorescent colors this time.
